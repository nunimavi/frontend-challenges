## Hello! 👋🏼

These are the challenges I’ve been completing from the [Frontend Mentor website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).
**I’d really appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement!**

> [!NOTE]
In each project, there’s a folder called `/design` where you can find the layout I had to recreate. You’ll find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

Thank you! 😊
