## Hello! 👋🏼

These are the challenges I’ve been working on from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) platform.

I’m continuously learning and improving, so any feedback or suggestions are very welcome!

> [!NOTE]
> Each project includes a `/design` folder containing the original layouts provided for the challenge.  
> You’ll find both mobile and desktop versions of the design used as reference.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my work! 😊
